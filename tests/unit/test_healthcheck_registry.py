# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# The registry named one installation's whole service inventory as a constant, so an
# install that does not run report-hub still got its three probes and they could only
# fail — `user_unit_active` against units that were never installed (2026-09-07,
# third-party single-node install; docs/troubleshooting/신규-노드-설치-공백.md §5).
# The deploy checkout is a one-way mirror, so the operator could not edit them out
# either; the only remedy available to them was to stop trusting the sweep.
#
# The direction of the default is the whole safety argument. Declaring nothing must
# keep every probe: a node whose environment was never updated has to keep monitoring
# exactly what it monitored yesterday, because a sweep that quietly checks less still
# reports ALL_HEALTHY. Narrowing is therefore something an installation opts INTO, and
# a name that is not a known group is refused rather than dropped — the same reason
# `automation/install/components.py:resolve_components` refuses unknown component names.
