"""YooDori gate `card-withdraw <draft id> <reason...>` (2026-10-26, owner Q367).

New file like test_yoodori_gate_mail_search.py: test_yoodori_gate.py pins the original argv byte
for byte. A card counts as YooDori's only when the gate's own log shows a mail-compose or mail-draft
call that ran while that draft was created - one that succeeded, or one the gate killed at its timeout
(rc=124; 2026-11-04 draft 36b605 was created and posted by a compose killed at 150 s); every other
card is refused before any child runs.
