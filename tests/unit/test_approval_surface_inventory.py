"""Static inventory locks for the owner-approval surface (AS-0.2, item (j)).

Split out of ``test_approval_surface_characterization.py`` to keep both files
small. The sets below are what a full AST scan of the deployed tree
(``skills/*/scripts/*.py`` + ``automation/**/*.py``) actually finds today, so a
newly added resolver, DM opener, or env override anywhere fails these tests. The
walk and the source glob are the shared ones in ``approval_conformance_ast``
(AS-1.11); this file keeps no private copy of either.

AS-1.x migrated EVERY approval flow onto the shared directory
``automation/interop/approval_directory.py``. Each one now reaches it through its
own binding adapter — ``triage_binding`` / ``budget_binding`` /
``patent_export_binding._directory`` /
``repair_ops_binding`` / ``calendar_binding`` / ``coordination_binding`` /
``wiki_binding`` / ``skill_gate_surface`` — so no flow defines an
``approvals_channel_id`` resolver or opens the owner DM itself any more. AS-3.2
then removed the five per-flow env overrides those adapters used to carry.

approvals-channel resolver definitions (0 — ``DiscordChannelDirectory``'s
``skill_approvals`` replaced all three; ``skill_gate`` now declares a kind and
``peer_attest`` is handed the channel its deploy request already resolved):
  (none)

owner-DM openers, i.e. sites naming ``/users/@me/channels`` (8 — the central
directory plus the seven DM senders it deliberately does NOT own; not one of the
seven is an approval path):
  skills/procurement/scripts/procure_review.py:67       send_review
  automation/cost-report/send_cost_report.py:176        send_dm
  automation/interop/gate_driver.py:83                  main
  automation/interop/hermes_plugin/__init__.py:189      _send_direct_result
  automation/reminder_poller/poll_reminders.py:165      DmSender.send
  automation/research_trends/research_trends.py:254     _send_dm
  automation/memory_curator/effects.py:71               alert_owner  (near-cap notice, not an approval)
  automation/interop/approval_directory.py:27           <module>  (AS-1.2 central directory)

``*_APPROVALS_CHANNEL_ID`` env overrides (0 — AS-3.2 retired every one; the
compatibility source that survives is the `personal_approvals_channel_id` config
key read inside the shared directory, which is not an env var and is not per-flow):
  (none)
