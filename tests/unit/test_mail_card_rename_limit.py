"""2026-11-04: a thread rename rate limit (429) must never cost a posted mail card its binding.

Discord allows two channel-name edits per ten minutes. Withdrawing a card marked its thread 💤 and
the revised card's 🔔 rename then hit 429; the shared REST helper slept on Retry-After, the node gate
killed compose at 150 s, and the card was left without reactions, without its message id and with a
posting journal no later tick could resolve (refused:posting-journal-stale).
