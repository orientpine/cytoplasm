"""A failed approved send is counted, backed off, capped and told to the owner.

2026-10-13: an owner-approved forward failed at the webmail compose step every watch
tick for over an hour. ``external_service_error`` was not counted as a failure, so the
draft stayed ``pending``, was retried every tick without end, the tick's failure never
reached the owner's approval thread, and the record said only
``browser_command_failed``.
