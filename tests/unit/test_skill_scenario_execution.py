"""Actually *runs* the skill scenarios that are provably side-effect-free.

`tests/unit/test_skill_scenario_drift.py` deliberately executes nothing: it
pins the drift that is visible statically (a scenario naming a path a migration
deleted, a scenario that stopped parsing) and its own guard asserts that the
module never invokes a scenario for real. That file is FS3-pinned — one added
line invalidates the recorded replay evidence — so the runtime half of the same
follow-up lives here instead of widening it.

The follow-up it closes: only 3 of 18 scenarios (calendar, mail, wiki, each in
its own dedicated test) run before deploy, so the remaining 15 first execute on
the peer node during `automation/deploy-skill.sh` stage 1 — the most expensive
place to discover a break. Dumping all 18 into the unit suite is not the fix:
most of them reach a real external-effect transport (Gmail send, Google Tasks
insert, Drive upload, an LLM CLI) and are offline *only* while an env-var stub
seam holds. This module therefore grows the covered set one skill at a time,
each run under a `mktemp` HOME (mode 700) with dummy credentials and a bounded
timeout, exactly the way deploy-skill.sh:853-858 shapes its sandbox. Bubblewrap
adds a process boundary: the repository is read-only, the real user HOME and
`/srv` are hidden, `/run` is empty, networking is unshared, and named service,
mail, browser, Drive, and model clients are refusing stubs that log every call.

Inventory — every `skills/*/scripts/scenario.sh`, classified by reading it.
SAFE means: no external-effect transport is reachable on any leg, every write
lands in a scenario-owned `mktemp -d`, and the executed path does not depend on
what happens to exist on the host. `_EXECUTED` / `_HELD_BACK` below are the
machine-consumed form of this table and must cover the on-disk set.

    | skill           | verdict | evidence                                        |
    |-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
    | budget          | UNSAFE  | successful mail leg replaces Gmail with a gws stub, so inclusion would only assert the stub call |
    | calendar        | UNSAFE  | successful insert/delete legs replace Calendar with a gws stub; already run by test_calendar_scenario.py |
    | coordination    | UNSAFE  | Discord CLI leg proves only tokenless refusal; no faithful transport execution |
    | doctype         | UNSAFE  | document prose and extraction are answers from a local Codex executable stub |
    | hello-autophagy | SAFE    | no seams at all: runs scripts/hello.sh and asserts its marker |
    | mail            | UNSAFE  | mailon send and Codex responses are local stubs; already run by test_mail_scenario.py |
    | meeting         | UNSAFE  | extraction consumes --offline recorded-response fixtures rather than the model boundary |
    | patent-prep     | UNSAFE  | Drive/age clients are canaries and only the no-manifest refusal leg executes |
    | plaud           | SAFE    | stdlib-only read of a mktemp state fixture; no transport, no writes outside mktemp |
    | procurement     | UNSAFE  | Discord review is stubbed and Drive is disabled, so no successful review delivery is exercised |
    | prompt          | SAFE    | local store only; hidden /srv fixes the repo root and explicit temp overlay/private roots hold writes |
    | proposal        | UNSAFE  | research, image, refine, and Drive success paths all use fake transports |
    | recall          | SAFE    | read-only skill; RECALL_FAKE_RESULTS / RECALL_FAKE_ERROR fixtures; writes confined to mktemp |
    | repair          | SAFE    | reads SKILL.md and asserts three substrings; no subprocess, no writes |
    | report          | SAFE    | recorded response/evidence fixtures exercise outputs; DRIVE_PUBLISH_ENABLED=0 is explicit and deniers stay untouched |
    | speechtotext    | UNSAFE  | transcript is recorded or emitted by fake whisper/ffmpeg; API leg points at a closed port |
    | todo            | UNSAFE  | successful Google Tasks insert/get uses an in-memory fake gws executable |
    | topics          | SAFE    | local YAML state under mktemp; KNOWLEDGE_FAKE_PACK is a read-only evidence fixture |
    | wiki            | SAFE    | no effect transport, but already run by test_wiki_scenario.py with a staged INTEROP_RUNTIME |

Determinism: no sleeps and no polling. The only time bound is the subprocess
timeout, which turns a hung scenario into a failure instead of a hang.
