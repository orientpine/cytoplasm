"""Telling the operator which declaration to paste, instead of making them derive it.

The declaration was shipped with documentation and nothing else, so a new operator had to
read `docs/guide/operations.md`, decide which service groups their installation runs, and
translate that into a variable — three steps in which only the last is mechanical. The
installation that prompted the feature had already worked out the answer the hard way, by
watching probes fail for services it never installed
(``docs/troubleshooting/신규-노드-설치-공백.md`` §5).

`--suggest` closes that gap from the other end: the node reports which groups look absent
and prints the line to paste. It deliberately uses only probe commands the SSH forced-command
allowlist already carries, so an operator can run it without regenerating anything.

The one thing it must never do is claim certainty it does not have. `systemctl is-active`
answers "inactive" both for a unit nobody installed and for one that just died, so a group
whose probes all fail is a QUESTION for the operator, not a conclusion. A partial failure is
never a question: some of the group answered, so the service is there and something is wrong.
