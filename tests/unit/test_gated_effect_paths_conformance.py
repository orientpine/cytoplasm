"""Every gated external effect has a whole approval path: card producer, ✅ watcher, test.

2026-10-07: an Obsidian note save was gated at push time but had no card producer and
no watcher, so the agent improvised and asked for ✅ on a chat message that nothing
read. The gate alone does not make an effect approvable — something must post the card
and something must act on its ✅. This ledger is the build-time answer to "where is the
card and who consumes it" for every denylist rule and every approval producer:

- a new rule in ``configs/external-effect-tools.yaml`` fails until it names its producers
  (or an exemption with a reason);
- a new producer in ``approval_conformance_inventory.APPROVAL_PRODUCERS`` fails until it
  names the watcher that executes after ✅ (a declared cron, a systemd unit in the tree,
  or a ``manual:`` reason) and a test file that exercises it.
