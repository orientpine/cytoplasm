    `find` then fails with "Failed to restore initial working directory" and exits
    non-zero, so `set -euo pipefail` aborted the deploy right after the tar extract —
    before the read-back and before the watcher wrapper was pushed. Measured in
    production 2026-08-22: the runtime landed, the wrapper did not, and every ingest
    tick stayed broken while the deployer looked like it had run.

    Scans EVERY shipped script rather than a named pair: the first version of this
    regression hardcoded two files and therefore did not see the RAG-stack deployer
    reintroduce the identical payload one PR later. Only REMOTE payloads are
    constrained; a local find runs in a directory its own caller can read.
