"""A withdrawn or superseded card is still marked when its thread was already closed (2026-10-26).

28fe93 was withdrawn at 19:29 KST inside a thread the release result had closed (archived) at
18:48 KST. Discord refuses edits in an archived thread (HTTP 400, code 50083), so the card kept its
live look and only ``MAIL-SUPERSEDE-MARK-FAIL ... err=HTTPError`` was printed. Separate file from
``test_mail_card_withdraw.py`` because this fixture models Discord's archived-thread refusal.
