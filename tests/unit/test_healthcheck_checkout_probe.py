"""Drift monitor: the ops deploy checkout must stay a one-way mirror of origin/main.

Agents and humans have repeatedly committed INSIDE ``/srv/autophagy-agents``, so prod ran
code that never reached origin/main and a later deploy from a clean checkout silently
reverted it (2026-07-27 선례: skills/mail/SKILL.md v1.5.3->v1.5.5, 4 commits recovered).
``probe_checkout_mirrors_origin`` is the DETECT half of the permanent fix: it fails when
HEAD is not an ancestor of origin/main, or when a tracked file is modified.

The probe is shell, so it is exercised as shell. ``ssh``/``sudo`` stand-ins placed first on
PATH run the remote command against a throwaway git repo in ``tmp_path`` — no node, no
network, no dependence on this repository's own git state.
