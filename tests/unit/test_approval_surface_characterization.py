"""Characterization locks for the owner-approval surface (AS-0.2).

Every assertion pins CURRENT behaviour, never desired behaviour, so that a later
AS task moving a flow has to update this file deliberately — and that deliberate
diff is the machine-checked "before/after" the migration is judged against.

All six flows — mail, budget, patent-export, repair,
calendar+coordination+wiki and the skill supply chain — now resolve their surface
ONCE through ``automation/interop/approval_directory.py`` and PERSIST the whole
binding on the pending record; the locks below assert that, and assert the
post-time resolvers are gone.

All four migrating flows — mail reply, budget, patent-export and repair —
coordination and wiki. Only the skill supply chain still lands on the guild
``#approvals`` surface, because the peer attestation bot posts there too.
The binding is
decided once before the post and written down instead of being re-derived on
every later read.

This file owns the mail locks (a), (i), the per-flow intent channel sources
(b), (e), (f), (g) and patent (c). Three siblings hold the rest, split out so
every file stays under the 250 pure-LOC ceiling:
``test_approval_surface_records.py`` (persisted record field sets and the skill
supply chain, items (c)-(h)), ``test_approval_surface_inventory.py`` (the static
inventory of channel resolvers, owner-DM openers and env overrides, item (j)),
and the two uncollected helpers ``approval_characterization_fixtures`` (the fake
directory and the mail gate bootstrap) and ``approval_characterization_ast``
(the verbatim source readers).
