"""Consecutive-failure escalation for no-agent cron watchers — one notice per incident.

WHY (2026-08-18): `mail-triage-watch` failed 111 ticks in a row and calendar/coordination
222 each, and cha learned about none of them — those jobs run `--deliver local`, which has
zero delivery targets, so the failure line went nowhere. The obvious fix (`--deliver
discord`) is worse for a high-frequency job: a stuck `*/2` watcher would send 720 DMs a day.

So the delivery target is not the knob. The knob is *how often a watcher speaks*: stay
silent while healthy, speak exactly once when a failure streak reaches the threshold, and
speak exactly once more when it recovers. That is the shape `automation/deploy_reconcile.py`
already uses (`FAILURE_NOTICE_THRESHOLD` + `incident_open`), reused here rather than
reinvented — with the state kept per watcher name so two watchers never share an incident.

WHY (t_2b8f1ab9 / recorded_failure_detail_unavailable_after_recovery): closing the streak
used to drop the redacted failing-tick line, so the recovery Discord notice said only
"recovered after N consecutive failures" and nothing anywhere still named WHAT failed.
The state now keeps a last_failure summary (already-redacted detail ≤200, first/last
failed-at as UTC ISO, count) across that reset, and the recovery line carries the window
and last failure so the owner can see the cause without digging. Old files without those
keys still load.

Deployed alongside the watchers in ``~/.hermes/scripts/`` and imported from there; it is a
helper, not a cron entrypoint (no ``__main__`` guard), so the deploy-coverage probe skips it.
