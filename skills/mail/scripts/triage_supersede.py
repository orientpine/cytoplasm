"""Close an undecided mail card without the owner: a newer draft, its requester, or a moved share.

Owner 2026-10-19 00:00 KST: revising one mail three times in one thread must not leave three
live cards. Only compose drafts written from that same thread qualify (a digest thread holds
cards of different mails). A card the owner already decided is left to the watcher.

Owner Q367 (2026-10-26 18:59 KST, "유돌이 자기 카드를 취소만 할 수 있게"): ``withdraw`` lets the
requester take back its own pending card under the same lease and probe. It only ever makes a
card terminal; whose card it is, the YooDori gate decides before calling it.
