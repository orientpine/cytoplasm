"""The day's digests as one standard approval thread (owner Q187, 2026-10-16).

The digest runs at 09:00, 13:00 and 19:00 KST (owner 2026-10-30); every run of a KST day
posts into that day's one thread, so the thread name carries the day only and each run's
first message carries its own time and count.

Mail owns the digest, so it opens the day's thread and decides when it is finished; the
shared state and the thread marks live in ``automation.interop.digest_thread``. A reply
draft asked for on a digest card (✍️ or a Discord reply) records that card as its origin,
which is how the draft's approval card finds this thread and its mail card.
