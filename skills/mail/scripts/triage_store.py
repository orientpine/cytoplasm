"""SQLite idempotency store for the mail triage pipeline (W4-2).

Reuses the W3-2 claim-before-send shape: a mail uid may be drafted only by the
process that wins the INSERT for its claim inside a BEGIN IMMEDIATE
transaction, so concurrent/duplicate 10-minute ticks produce at most one draft
per mail. `processed` marks terminal outcomes; `counters` tracks the
consecutive approved-send failure count that drives the mail-mode NO-GO
downgrade (2 consecutive failures → W4-2-runtime re-verdict).
