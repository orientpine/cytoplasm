"""no_agent wrapper for Hermes cron `mail-daily-digest` (08:00 KST) that sends
the owner mail digest; silent on success.

Thin wrapper: runs the mounted mail skill CLI `digest` subcommand. no_agent
semantics: empty stdout + exit 0 on success (silent tick); on failure prints one
masked line and exits 1 so the scheduler records an alert. Deployed copy lives
at ~/.hermes/scripts/mail_digest_watch.py (Hermes cron sandbox rule); the skill
CLI stays the single implementation in the immutable governed live store at
/srv/autophagy-skills/live/mail/scripts/ — no import of it here, subprocess
only (avoids the W3-2 cron-sandbox PYTHONPATH package-shadowing trap).

The CLI and this wrapper speak one contract: every digest failure surfaces as
exactly one structured ``DIGEST-FAIL stage=... retry_safe=... code=...`` line.
This wrapper passes a child marker through verbatim, or synthesizes a
``stage=runner`` marker when the child produced none (crash, non-marker exit,
or unmounted skill). In-tick retry fires ONLY for ``retry_safe=true`` markers;
a ``retry_safe=false`` failure (a delivery that may already have sent some
Discord chunks, or a build item that may already have delegated a calendar
draft) is never auto-replayed, so the owner never receives a duplicate.

The marker is written to STDOUT: Hermes ``--no-agent`` delivers the script's
stdout verbatim to the cron ``--deliver`` owner-DM target, and drops stderr
(verified in the 2026-07-31 saved cron output). Success is an empty stdout
(silent tick); a failure is the one marker line + exit 1, which the cron
delivers to cha — rather than the app re-sending a DM through the failing path.
