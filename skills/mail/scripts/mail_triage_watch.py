"""Mail triage watcher (W4-2) — Hermes cron job, no_agent script mode, every 10 min.

Thin wrapper: runs the mounted mail skill CLI `watch` subcommand (reposts
unposted pending drafts, resolves owner ✅/⛔ reactions, sends approved
drafts — no auto-drafting: drafts are owner-initiated via the `draft`
subcommand). no_agent semantics: empty stdout + exit 0 on success (silent tick);
an expected child failure is recorded in the failure streak and also exits 0 —
under ``--deliver discord`` the scheduler posts its own failure banner for ANY
non-zero exit regardless of stdout (2026-08-24 budget-watch measurement), and a
stuck ``*/2`` job exiting 1 would be 720 banners a day, the exact flood the
streak model exists to prevent. Only a failure the streak could NOT record
(helper missing/broken) keeps exit 1 so the banner stays as the last line of
defence. Deployed copy lives at ~/.hermes/scripts/mail_triage_watch.py (Hermes
cron sandbox rule); the skill CLI stays the single implementation in the
immutable governed live store at /srv/autophagy-skills/live/mail/scripts/ — no
import of it here, subprocess only (avoids the W3-2 cron-sandbox PYTHONPATH
package-shadowing trap).
