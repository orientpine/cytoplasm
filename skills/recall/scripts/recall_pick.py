"""The agent's own recall call gets the same whole-store pick as automatic recall (owner Q150).

The owner card from YooDori's memory copy is offered first on every call (owner Q433).

Any model or search-shape failure falls back to the plain search, reported as not picked, so a
deployment order where the RAG server is not yet rebuilt still answers.
