# automation/checkout_mirror_probe.sh — is the ops deploy checkout still a clean
# one-way mirror of origin/main? Sourced by healthcheck.sh (the DETECT half) and
# by land.sh (the CONVERGE half), so both judge drift by one rule. land.sh runs
# from the workstation, so it ships these functions to the node BY VALUE
# (declare -f) rather than sourcing the node's copy: since DG-6 a dirty mirror
# only warns, and executing that mirror's shell as ops would take the warning's
# safety case away.
#
# WHY it is its own file: healthcheck.sh sits 5 lines under the 250 pure-LOC gate,
# and the verdict logic plus its two recovery texts do not fit. Extracting them
# keeps healthcheck.sh under the ceiling and hands land.sh the same primitive.
#
# WHY it exists at all, three dated faults:
#   2026-07-27  a commit made INSIDE /srv/autophagy-agents stranded work nowhere
#               else and blocked every session's ff-pull  → detected as mirror-ahead.
#   2026-07-29  the SSH probe was allowlist-denied (rc=126) AND the nested
#               `sudo -n -u ops` was sudoers-denied (rc=126) — TWO stacked denials
#               on one command, so the probe never ran. Fix: run LOCALLY on the
#               cron host (the checkout is local there), needing neither ssh nor sudo.
#   2026-07-29  ops sat 11 commits BEHIND origin after another session's push, and
#               the old probe compared against its own stale ref  → detected as
#               mirror-behind via `git ls-remote` (a network READ that writes no
#               local ref, so the read-only invariant holds: never fetch/pull/reset).

# Print exactly one verdict word; return 0 only for mirror-clean. Order matters:

The ops deploy checkout is behind origin/main. Whether that means prod is stale
depends on the node: with the immutable release live it is only this observation
post that lagged; with no release installed it IS prod running stale code.
Converge it non-destructively from the workstation:
  workstation$  automation/land.sh      # push + converge the runtime, verified
or, if nothing is unpushed, just:
  here$         git pull --ff-only
BEHIND_EOF
      ;;
    *)
      cat <<'AHEAD_EOF'
The ops deploy checkout is a one-way mirror of origin/main: the only writes
allowed inside it are git fetch and git pull --ff-only. This failure means a
commit was made there, or a tracked file was edited there.
Recover WITHOUT discarding the work - it exists nowhere else:
  here$         git format-patch origin/main..HEAD
  workstation$  git am *.patch && git push origin main
  here$         git pull --ff-only
Never git reset --hard, git checkout --, or git stash first.

# The generation production is actually running, "" when there is none. Same rule as

# A behind mirror is graded by WHAT PRODUCTION RUNS, never by the mirror alone.
# Since DG-5 this checkout is an observation post: the reconcile timer converges the
# release from a DETACHED snapshot worktree and by design never moves this HEAD, so every
# landing left it behind while prod was exactly current — 447 failures measured between
# 2026-07-29 and 08-03, which is the cry-wolf this file exists to avoid. land.sh already
# grades that case a warning (LAND-MIRROR-WARN); this is the detect half agreeing.
#
# What must NOT be traded away for the quiet is the opposite case: there is no separate
# `release == origin/main` probe, so a stale release is visible only here. Hence the
# grade asks origin, not the mirror's own (possibly stale) ref.
# Is prod merely CATCHING UP rather than stuck? 0 = grace it, 1 = call it stale.
#
# The answer is not ours to invent: the reconciler already owns "a behind prod is now an
# incident" (DRIFT_NOTICE_SECONDS / FAILURE_NOTICE_THRESHOLD) and pages the owner on it.
# Deciding it a second time here is the same defect this file's behind-grading fixed on
# the land.sh side — two judges, one question, different answers — so we read its verdict
# instead of racing it. Measured: origin moves, the 2-minute timer converges the release,
# and a 5-minute healthcheck tick landing in that gap paged for a healthy node.
#
# Fail-closed in every direction: no file, unreadable, malformed, or a reconciler that has
# gone quiet for its own threshold all return 1. Silence must never buy silence — on
# 2026-08-02 the timer ran ~450 times in 15h without ever reaching save_state.
