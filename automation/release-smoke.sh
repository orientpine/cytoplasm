# Post-convergence validation for the release reconciler — and ONLY for it.
#
# `apply_release_update` installs a release, restarts the gateway pair, then runs this to
# decide whether to keep the new generation or roll it back. It runs as the reconciler
# does: `User=ops`, whose entire sudo grant is five `(root) NOPASSWD` lines for the
# release helpers. ops cannot become agent and cannot become peer.
#
# What used to sit here was `automation/deploy-smoke.sh`, which is a DIFFERENT thing: a
# standalone daily hygiene smoke with its own provisioner and its own timer
# (`provision-deploy-smoke.sh`, `autophagy-deploy-smoke.timer`), whose job is
# `deploy-skill.sh hello-autophagy --sandbox-only` — a real peer staging run. From ops
# that is not merely unlikely to pass, it is impossible: measured 2026-08-19,
# `sudo: a password is required` → `SELF-SKILL-COLLISION-BLOCK`, and ops had never
# written a `~/.hermes/deploy-smoke/tick.json` at all. Every convergence therefore built
# its release and was rolled back one step later. The two smokes are not merged: they
# answer different questions from different accounts.
#
# So this asks only what ops can actually answer, and each answer is one the reconciler
# would be wrong to skip:
#   1. the store agrees the pointer is the generation it just installed
#   2. the release tree IMPORTS — every cron watcher imports `automation.*` from it, so a
#      tree that cannot be imported is a node whose automation is silently dead
#   3. the gateway pair is HEALTHY, not merely restarted — the success path previously
#      took `systemctl restart` accepting the job as proof the pair came back
