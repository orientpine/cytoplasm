"""One standard approval thread per digest day (owner Q187, 2026-10-16).

The digest runs at 09:00, 13:00 and 19:00 KST (owner 2026-10-30); all runs of one KST
day share that day's thread.

The mail digest opens it through the standard per-request path (`approval_surface`
`resolve_new_binding` with a `RequestThread`), so its parent notice, name and big title
are the same as every other approval thread. Approval cards born from that digest -- a
reply draft made with a reaction or a reply, the calendar card of a mail's event --
post into it as replies under their mail card instead of opening threads of their own.

Mail and calendar run as separate processes, so the binding lives in one small state
file per KST day, written once under a file lock and read by both. Requests that did
not come from the digest never look here and keep their own threads.

The thread's mark follows its cards (`settle`): undecided cards -> the bell mark; no
undecided card and a newer digest exists -> closed as done and archived.
