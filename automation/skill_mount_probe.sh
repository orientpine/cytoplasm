# automation/skill_mount_probe.sh — do the mounted skills still carry the release's
# content? Sourced by healthcheck.sh (the DETECT half of "커밋됨 ≠ 배포됨").
#
# WHY it is its own file: healthcheck.sh sits a few lines under the 250 pure-LOC gate
# and the probe plus its recovery text do not fit. Same reason — and same shape — as
# checkout_mirror_probe.sh.
#
# WHY it exists at all: merging moves the release (a git sha); it never moves a skill
# mount (a content hash). The two converge independently, so a skill can sit on stale
# content while the release is already at origin/main — and unlike a blocked ff-pull,
# that state makes NO noise. Measured 2026-08-01: the release was at 79faef4
# (= origin/main) while calendar·prompt·recall·todo·wiki had been stale for two days,
# left behind by a partial deploy of 611595f (doctype·mail went, the rest did not).
# A partial deploy is the quietest kind: a deploy did happen, so nobody looks again.
#
# The verdict itself lives in skill_mount_drift.py so it is pinned by unit tests
# instead of by this shell. Read-only: it never deploys and never writes.

# Self-contained on purpose (checkout_mirror_probe.sh's shape): it resolves the runtime
# root itself rather than leaning on the sourcing script, so a caller can ship it by
# value the way land.sh does with the checkout probe.
