"""Naming and placement rules for the single Drive outputs tree (pure logic).

Owns the ONLY registry of output categories so no caller hardcodes a folder
name: ``<root>/<category>/<YYYY>/<date-prefixed file | bundle folder>/<file>``
with the root counted as depth 1 and depth 5 as the hard ceiling (a bundle's
own files sit at the ceiling; shallower placements such as a budget sheet at
``예산/<YYYY>/<sheet>`` stay legal). Gate-only kinds (patent) are refused here
— they belong to their dedicated export gate.

No Drive I/O lives in this module; ``automation.drive_outputs`` is the publish
facade that turns these names into gws calls.
