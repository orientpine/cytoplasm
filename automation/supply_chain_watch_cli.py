"""The watcher's node wiring: assemble the tick from the gate's own identity, then run it.

FA-3. Everything this decides is already assembled and tested elsewhere; the job here is
to hand `watch_tick` the three things it cannot invent — how to ask the gate what the owner
said, how to actually run a resume, and how to tell an approval that already mounted from
one that never did — and to do that without introducing a second source of truth for any.

The identity is the gate's. ``skill_gate._identity()`` is the canonical factory and the
directory it returns is the only resolver of a surface, so this module never builds one,
never reads a token, and never names a channel. It borrows.

What it does own is the subprocess boundary, and the one rule there is that the exit code
survives verbatim: the outcome table distinguishes lease contention from an owner
cancellation by number alone, and swallowing or remapping that number would erase the
distinction the last fix existed to create. A command that cannot even start reports 127
rather than raising, because a tick that dies mid-directory starves every approval behind
it — silently, which is the failure this whole feature removes.

Deployment note the unit file repeats: this must NOT run with ``ProtectHome=yes``. The
records, the interop config and the bot token all live under the record owner's ``$HOME``.
