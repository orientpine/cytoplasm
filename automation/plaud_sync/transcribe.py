"""Local transcription stage — ``transcribing`` → ``planned`` with the node's own transcript.

Discovery freezes a recording with Plaud's cloud draft but marks it ``transcribing``
(2026-09-04, owner request): the approval card must quote the transcript the NODE
produced — whisper.cpp + sherpa speaker diarization through the governed speechtotext
CLI — not Plaud's. This module is the pure step: which records to work on, how a CLI
result becomes note text, and what a failure means. Every effect (MCP, S3,
subprocess, locks, state writes) is injected; ``transcribe_live`` binds them.

Two failure classes, on purpose. An *environment* failure (no toolchain, governed
refusal, MCP or network error) retries every tick without counting — the owner fixes
the node and the recording waits visibly in ``plaud 상태``. A *recording* failure (the
CLI refused or timed out on this audio, the download broke the cap) counts toward
``max_attempts``; at the cap the record is promoted with the cloud transcript and the
note's source line says so, because a lifelog note stuck forever helps nobody.
