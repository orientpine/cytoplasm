#: The separable deployments an installation may run. `core` is what every install has;
#: the others exist on some installations and not others, and a probe for a service that
#: was never installed can only fail — `user_unit_active` against a unit nobody placed.
#: A third-party single-node install met exactly that on 2026-09-07 and could not edit the
#: rows out either: the deploy checkout is a one-way mirror
#: (docs/troubleshooting/신규-노드-설치-공백.md §5).

#: Parse the declaration ONCE, and parse ALL of it. Plain `read -ra` stops at the first
#: newline, so a value written across lines — ordinary in a shell profile or a systemd
#: EnvironmentFile — silently dropped every name after the first: validation never saw
#: them and the filter never emitted them, exiting 0 the whole way. That is the exact
#: silence this option exists to remove, so it must not return through how the value is
#: read. `-d ''` consumes the whole value and then reports EOF, which `set -e` must not
#: mistake for a failure. Both consumers read this one array so they cannot disagree
#: about what was declared.
#: The installer renders the declaration it derived from the chosen profile into a
#: root-owned file, so a fresh node never derives it by hand. Only an UNSET variable
#: falls back to the file: an operator who exported the variable — even empty, meaning
#: "every probe" — is overriding the installer's answer on purpose.
