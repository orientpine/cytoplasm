# automation/rag_ingest/deploy.sh — deploy the personal-RAG ingest runtime + watcher.
#
# Deploys the tracked rag_ingest *.py package (top-level cron/ excluded) to
# ~agent/.hermes/rag_ingest_runtime/rag_ingest/ with deploy_tree_swap, so the wrapper's
# `sys.path.insert(RUNTIME_DIR); from rag_ingest.cli import ...` and recall's search path
# resolve. cron/ is excluded because its wrapper has a separate, manifest-observed
# destination in the Hermes scripts directory. The destination is declared in
# deploy-manifest.txt, so a release can see a stale copy and re-ship it.
#
# The swap holds the watcher's own flock. A tick can therefore run before or after
# deployment, never while a partially extracted package is visible.
# Provenance enforces commit -> push -> deploy; origin/main must already contain it.
