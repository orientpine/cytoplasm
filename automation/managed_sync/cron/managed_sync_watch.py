"""One managed-skill sync tick — the single tick implementation both deployments run.

Two deployments share this file, which is why the tick logic lives here and not in
either deployer:

- ``automation/managed_sync/deploy.sh`` pushes it to ``~/.hermes/scripts/managed_sync_watch.py``
  and registers the Hermes no-agent cron (the existing watcher convention);
- ``automation/managed_sync/systemd/autophagy-managed-sync.{service,timer}`` runs the same
  path out of the immutable release for installs driven by ``automation/install``
  (an OPT-IN component — it is not installed unless the operator asks for it).

Git-polling manual indexer (rag-ingest-watch class, 규약 (a) 예외): each tick runs
exactly one ``sync`` subcommand pass. Managed skills still stop at verify + quarantine;
the same shared-mirror tick separately verifies and atomically refreshes the roster.
Owner-gated steps stay owner-gated: this wrapper never invokes any other subcommand and
never passes any extra flag. **Delivery is automatic; MOUNTING is not** (D3) — a staged
release sits in quarantine until the subscriber's own ✅ mounts it, so nothing here
may reach the mount path.

No-agent cron contract (docs/guide/watcher-cron-설계규약.md):
- (b) secrets are self-loaded from ``~/.env.secrets`` (system env wins);
- (b-2) the child subprocess receives credentials via an explicit ``env=``;
- (c) the runtime root is resolved by the DG-4 order and exported to the child as BOTH
  ``AUTOPHAGY_REPO_ROOT`` and ``AUTOPHAGY_RUNTIME_ROOT`` plus ``PYTHONPATH``;
- (i) the owner notice is best-effort — a failed notice never undoes a staged release;
- overlapping ticks are serialised by the repo's standard ``FileKeyLease``; the loser
  exits 0 silently rather than reporting an incident that did not happen.
